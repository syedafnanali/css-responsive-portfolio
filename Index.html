    My name is Syed Afnan Ali.I am 26 years old. I am interested in multiple disciplines of education. My actual educational background is in Business Administration.I am interested in having an understanding about deep questions in life .That is what drives me I believe. I like problem solving ;that's what makes me interested in coding. I think coding helps me understand deeper concepts not only about building a website but i think it can be looked as a metaphor to other things in life.We create a page from scratch and then it evolves with our understanding as we learn and apply it to the website we are building just like we do in life.We learn, we evolve (physically and in our ideas) and then we apply it to our environment;whether it be virtual or natural.My plan with this bootcamp is to try to achieve as extensive knowledge as possible about all the languages and programs we will learn throughout the whole program.So, I am able to have a career in Web Development and with experience eventually be able to build up a team and start my own studio. Doing a job in web Development is not my ultimate goal but a step towards it. I really like doing coding because it forces me to think outside the box ; an activity which i very much like and apprecite to have an opportunity where i could build a career doing it.</p>
